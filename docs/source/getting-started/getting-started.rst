Alright, you have read basic information of the IoTCrawler components and have brief idea about the overall architecture. Now, you want to run an 
instance of IoTCrawler. Before, we get into the specifics of IoTCrawler components, it is advised to install all the :doc:`prerequisites` installed on your machine.

Once you have installed the prerequisites, you are ready to :doc:`start-metadata-repository`, which is one of the core components of the IoTCrawler.
