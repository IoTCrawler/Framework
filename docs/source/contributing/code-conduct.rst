IoTCrawler Code of Conduct
##########################
IoTCrawler is a collaborative project under European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program. It is an open-source and open community project where participants choose to work together, and in that process experience differences in language, location, nationality, and experience. In such a diverse environment, misunderstandings and disagreements happen, which in most cases can be resolved informally. In rare cases, however, behavior can intimidate, harass, or otherwise disrupt one or more people in the community, which IoTCrawler will not tolerate.

A Code of Conduct is useful to define accepted and acceptable behaviors and to promote high standards of professional practice. It also provides a benchmark for self evaluation and acts as a vehicle for better identity of the organization.

This code (CoC) applies to any member of the IoTCrawler community â€“ developers, participants in meetings, teleconferences, mailing lists, conferences or functions, etc. Note that this code complements rather than replaces legal rights and obligations pertaining to any particular situation.

Statement of Intent
*******************
IoTCrawler is committed to maintain a positive :ref:`work environment<Work Environment>`. This commitment calls for a workplace where :ref:`participants<Participant>` at all levels behave according to the rules of the following code. A foundational concept of this code is that we all share responsibility for our work environment.

Code
****
1. Treat each other with :ref:`respect<Respect>`, professionalism, fairness, and sensitivity to our many differences and strengths, including in situations of high pressure and urgency.

2. Never :ref:`harass<Harassment>` or :ref:`bully<Workplace Bullying>` anyone verbally, physically or :ref:`sexually<Unwelcome Sexual Advance>`.

3. Never :ref:`discriminate<Discrimination>` on the basis of personal characteristics or group membership.

4. Communicate constructively and avoid :ref:`demeaning<Demeaning Behavior>` or :ref:`insulting<Insulting Behavior>` behavior or language.

5. Seek, accept, and offer objective work criticism, and :ref:`acknowledge<Acknowledgement>` properly the contributions of others.

6. Be honest about your own qualifications, and about any circumstances that might lead to conflicts of interest.

7. Respect the privacy of others and the confidentiality of data you access.

8. With respect to cultural differences, be conservative in what you do and liberal in what you accept from others, but not to the point of accepting disrespectful, unprofessional or unfair or :ref:`unwelcome behavior<Unwelcome Behavior>` or :ref:`advances<Unwelcome Sexual Advance>`.

9. Promote the rules of this Code and take action (especially if you are in a :ref:`leadership position<Leadership Position>`) to bring the discussion back to a more civil level whenever inappropriate behaviors are observed.

10. Stay on topic: Make sure that you are posting to the correct channel and avoid off-topic discussions. Remember when you update an issue or respond to an email you are potentially sending to a large number of people.

11. Step down considerately: Members of every project come and go, and the IoTCrawler is no different. When you leave or disengage from the project, in whole or in part, we ask that you do so in a way that minimizes disruption to the project. This means you should tell people you are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where you left off.
