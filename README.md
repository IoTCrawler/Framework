# IoTCrawler Framework
IoTCrawler is a research project funded under the European Union's Horizon 2020 reserach and innovation program. The aim of the project is to develop a search engine for the Internet of Things (IoT), enabling search on itâ€™s devices. IoTCrawler focuses on integration and interoperability across different platforms, dynamic and reconfigurable solutions for discovery and integration of data and services from legacy and new systems, adaptive, privacy-aware and secure algorithms and mechanisms for crawling, indexing, and search in distributed IoT systems. The project spans industry, universities and cities. It is comporised of multiple components:
## [Scorpio Broker](https://github.com/IoTCrawler/ScorpioBroker)
Scorpio is an NGSI-LD compliant context broker. 
## [Indexing](https://github.com/IoTCrawler/Indexing)
The Indexing component provides the mechanism of crawling, discovery, indexing, and integration of IoT resrouces (data and services) in large scale distributed dynamic IoT environments. 
## [Ranking](https://github.com/IoTCrawler/Ranking)
The Ranking component facilitates ranking mechanism for IoT resources. Ranking and resource selection rely on the registry built (and constantly updated) by crawling and indexing methods. The purpose of Ranking is to aid users and applications to not only find a set of resources relevant to their needs, but also to select the best or most appropriate one(s) from that set. There are multiple criterias for ranking IoT resources such as data type, proximity, latency, availability. The Ranking component supports application-dependent,multi-criteria ranking.
